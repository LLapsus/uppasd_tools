UppASD Tools documentation
==========================

**UppASD Tools** is intended for researchers using the 
`UppASD (Uppsala Atomistic Spin Dynamics) package <https://github.com/UppASD/UppASD>`_
to streamline post-processing and analysis of simulation outputs.
The package focuses on robust parsing of common UppASD output formats into pandas DataFrames, 
enabling direct use of the results with standard Python tools for data analysis and visualization.
