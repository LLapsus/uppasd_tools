Introduction

**UppASD Tools** is intended for researchers using the 
`UppASD (Uppsala Atomistic Spin Dynamics) <https://github.com/UppASD/UppASD>`_
package to streamline post-processing and analysis of simulation outputs.

The package focuses on robust parsing of common UppASD output formats into
pandas DataFrames, enabling direct use of the results with standard Python tools
for data analysis and visualization.

The core design principle of UppASD Tools is to expose simulation results as
structured tabular data, allowing users to build their own analysis workflows
on top of familiar Python libraries.

If you are new to the package, start with the :doc:`quick_start` guide. Detailed
documentation of individual modules and functions can be found in the
:doc:`api/index` section.
