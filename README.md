# UppASD Tools

[UppASD](https://github.com/UppASD/UppASD) (Uppsala Atomistic Spin Dynamics) is a simulation suite to study magnetization dynamics by means of atomistic version of the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation. Beside that it provides Monte Carlo methods to estimate equilibrium propertioes of magnetic materials.

**UppASD Tools** is a package for handling UppASD output files. I allows read, parse and process basic output files in a simple way in a Python code.
